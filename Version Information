04-10-2022 (Initial Prototype)
Very, very basic version; functional but crude 

06-10-2022 (Version 0.1)
Complete rebuild of the entire Beliefs.json from the ground up, additional buildings added; general rework of religion in general.

07-10-2022 (Version 0.3 initial release)
Let's. Heccin. GOOOOOOOOOO-!

Known issues: Images need compiling, none of the Wonders have quotes yet, whatever Day Zero fixes I'll be doing once I get all this in game.

08-10-2022 (Version 0.4) 
*Numerous* bugs squashed; wasn't incriminating that because I was going through builds too quickly
Incrementing to 0.4 because I added a modOptions.json to (hopefully) remove the depricated Beliefs.
Now if only I knew why half of the things don't show up, and why the buy with faith stuff isn't showing up.

11-10-2022 (Version 0.4.1)
Fixed "a metric ton" of uncaught errors because the mod test *doesn't test things against the stock rulesets automatically like it should* 
Hopefully things will *mostly* actually *work* now.

13-10-2022 (Version 0.4.2)
Fixed *more* uncaught errors (thanks to carriontrooper for nailing a couple of those)
Attempting to make the extra Beliefs when founding and enhancing religions actually work by putting them in modOptions; the original workaround
that modified the Palace has been depricated.

13-10-2023 (Version 0.4.3) (later in the day)
Restored palace modification *with the right syntax this time;* now actually working as intended.
That's enough to increment by itself. Getting closer to not having any glitches in the base package lads!
Unfortunately I also had to remove Religious Practice because *apparently* you can't put follower beliefs in with just Pantheon level religions
For some reason.  * Confused face *
