(Note: duplicates will be incremented (Naturalism II, Naturalism III, etc) and will not show in the Civilopedia, because they're in there for mechanical reasons.)

//These give you a population based bonus, but you only ever get one; Yes even the duplicates are getting Only available'd. 
//Yes this is a messy pain in the ass. No there really isn't any other way to implement this as desired.
